  Here are some facts about me: 
  <p> On my free time one thing I am very passionate about is writing screenplays for either animated or live action tv shows or movies wether or not they are based off of a franchise or something that is original that I have created. A goal that I would like to complete one day is to publish some of my screen work and to make it a career, I want to make movies and tv shows. English class was my favorite class for every level of school therefore I enjoy reading and writing thanks to all of the great english teachers I've had. </p>  
  <p> Psychology is the main major I'm pursuing for college so I can become a guidance counsler for young adults, teens, and children. While in high school I depended on guidance counslers since I wasn't focused on doing school work while at school due to me almost becoming homeless and me losing my mother and they made me feel safer and more calm being in that enviroment while I was there. The reason why I want to be a guidance counsler is because I want to inspire the youth and lead kids and teens to a more positive route and to help guide them to do better in school and in life. </p> 
  <p> I collect vintage comic books, more specifically any comics that were released between 1950 and 1999.  </p>

  An article that I would like you to view: 
  <a href="https://www.yourarticlelibrary.com/organization/perception-and-its-influence-on-individual-behaviour/44941"> article by Clifton,New Jersey Neurofeedback </a>
    <p>This article is posted here to show one of the many topics that I would like to teach to a group of people about communicating with others, especially now since people are more sensitive towards certain topics leading others to be more defensive. The reason why I made this website is to help others communicate with one another and to counsel those who need help and guidance through life.</p>

  Here are some fun facts about me: 
  <p> I write screenplays. A goal that I would like to complete one day is to publish some of my screen work and to make it a career, I want to make movies and tv shows. English class was my favorite therefore I enjoy reading and writing. </p>  
  <p> Psychology is the main major I'm pursuing for college so I can become a guidance counsler. While in high school I depended on guidance counslers since I wasn't focused on doing school work while at school and they made me feel safer and more calm being in that enviroment while there. The reason why I want to be a guidance counsler is because I want to inspire the youth and lead kids and teens to a more positive route and to help guide them to do better in school and in life. </p> 
  <p> I collect vintage comic books, more specifically any comics that were released between 1950 and 1999.  </p>
